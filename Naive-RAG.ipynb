Deep Learning employs neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns, making it a powerful approach for tasks like Computer Vision. The context doesn't detail the *specifics* of neural network architecture, training, or operation, but it establishes their role as multi-layered structures that enable the learning of complex patterns from data, a core aspect of Machine Learning models. Thus, neural networks are used within machine learning to learn from training data and make predictions, particularly when dealing with complex data as found in Computer Vision.\n",
